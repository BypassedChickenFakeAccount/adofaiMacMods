Keep in mind some commands have a space after they finish (like steps 4-6). THE SPACE IS IMPORTANT AND SO IS CAPITALISATION AND OTHER SHIT CODING IS SPECIFIC

HOW TO INSTALL

Step 1: Go to Steam and right click on ADOFAI in the game libraries and click properties -> browse game files to access the games files (folder shown in video)

Step 2: Drag and drop everything from maidoutfit.zip to that folder

Step 3: Open terminal

Step 4: type `cd ` then click on the text on the top in finder to get a little folder icon. Drag and drop that in for your folder path. Click enter

Step 5: type `chmod a+x ` then drag and drop run_bepinex.sh. Click enter

Step 6: type `sudo arch -x86_64 ` then drag and drop run_bepinex.sh. Click enter

TO MAKE ADOFAI EXECUTABLE FILE (command to copy)

!! Ensure you replace {GAMEDIRECTORY} with the folder path of ADOFAI (done by clicking on top of finder and dragging the mini folder icon that pops up) !!

`echo "cd {GAMEDIRECTORY};chmod a+x ./run_bepinex.sh;sudo arch -x86_64 ./run_bepinex.sh" > ~/Desktop/adofai;chmod a+x adofai`
